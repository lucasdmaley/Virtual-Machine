Most Expensive Operation:
The most time expensive operation in our program is the switch statement used 
to discern which set of instructions to run given an opcode. From what we gather
based on our assembly code, there are no obvious optimizations to this code. 
Registers are used appropriately (there are no calls to the stack pointer) and 
there does not appear to be any unnecessary memory accesses. There also does 
not appear to be any unnecessary computation in our switch statement.

The first instruction compares 13 with the value in %rax, which contains the 
op code of the instruction to execute. This is necessary to check if the 
default case has to be invoked.

The second instruction jumps to the default case if %rax > 13.

The third instruction calculates the memory address of the relevant case by 
multiplying the opcode. In using this calculation, there is no need to check 
for specific values of opcodes (as an if/else statement would), hence this 
seems the most efficient method of going to the relevant code to execute.

The absence of the stack pointer in our assembly code suggests that most if not
all of the registers are being used to efficiently hold memory data rather 
than being monitored on the stack.
